**`The Rising Analyst (Data Science/Machine Learning/Data Mining)`**

From becoming a TA teaching economics in English at National Dong Hwa University(NDHU, Taiwan), to becoming a Founder of an e-commerce company as a sophomore, to becoming the only 3 Excellent TA invited to share experiences in an NDHU publication, and to now studying MS Business Analytics at one of the Best Business Schools in the world(Bentley University), who can make impacts in the world of big data. I am constantly challenging myself to learn outside my comfort zone and always aiming for the sky to be the best version of myself.
